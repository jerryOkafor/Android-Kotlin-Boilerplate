## What you can learn from this repo

- How to implement `UI tests(Instrumentation)` using Espresso and `logic tests (Unit test)` using JUnit4.
- Fundamental Kotlin language and basic usage.
- Continuous Integration with Travis ci.

### Directory Description

## data
The data package contains the datasource interface and the Repository which implements the interface.

* DataSource : This is the data source contracta that any possible datasource for our app must implement
* Repository: A simple implementation of the Datasource interface.

## di
This package conatains all the dependency intergration stuff which  inclucde the 


* AppComponent: Combines all the app modules and inejct it into the app

* AppInjector: Used to dynamically init the App Components and inject activity and fragments
* AppModule: Contains injection for the application specif modules
* BuildersModule: Provides all the components and subcomponents necessary for inejecting int Fragments and activity.
* Injectable: A simple interface used to indicate that a fragment is injecatble
* PerActivity: Interface used to scope dependencies to activity.
* PerChildFragment: Interface used to scope dependencies to the ChildFrgaments in the case of nested  Fragments
* Fragment Scopes : Interface used to scope dependencies to Fragments
* ViewmodelKey : Dagger binding key for ViewModels
* ViewModelModules: Provides injectors for the Android Achiteacture Component ViewModoel.

### model
This package holds all the models for our app which one of them at the momnent is User

### ui
This packge holds the Fragments, Activities and the viewModels

### util
This package holds all the utility files thate we may need from time to time.
